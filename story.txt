Louis[n] went[v] to the store[n], and it was fun[a]. He taught[v] the class[n].
In the Pacific[n] Northwest's somber embrace.
Kurt Cobain's presence left a trace.
Born in Aberdeen[n], a troubled soul.
His creativity a shiny roll.

With Novoselic, Grohl, a trio of might.
Nirvana's music pierced the night.
Yet amidst the fame, a darkness grew.
Cobain's inner battles[v], known to few.

'Nevermind' soared high and wide.
Grunge's anthem, a tormented guide.
Youth's disenchanted hearts found their song.
In his haunting verses, they did belong.
